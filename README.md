# Detection model
Model for detection of ripe flowers of the Alstroemeria genus Morado

## Information
This project is part of the course _Seminar Computer Vision by Deep Learning_ (CS4245) 2020-2021 at the TU Delft. 

## Blog
A [blog](https://stanzwinkels.medium.com/2028186f50af) has been written about the project.

## Code
The Jupyter Notebook [detection_model.ipynb](https://github.com/TedDeVriesLentsch/ComputerVision_Group20/blob/main/detection_model.ipynb) contains the code for training and testing the model and the used data is from the dataset [morado_5may](https://www.kaggle.com/teddevrieslentsch/morado-5may). The Jupyter Notebook [ReLabel.ipynb](https://github.com/TedDeVriesLentsch/ComputerVision_Group20/blob/main/ReLabel.ipynb) contains the code for relabeling the annotations of the dataset.
