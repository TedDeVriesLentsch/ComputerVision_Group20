# Detection model
Model for detection of ripe flowers of the Alstroemeria genus Morado

This project is part of the course _Seminar Computer Vision by Deep Learning 2020-2021_ (CS4245) at the TU Delft. A [blog](https://stanzwinkels.medium.com/2028186f50af) has been written about the project.

The Jupyter Notebook [detection_model.ipynb]() contains the code for training and testing the model and the used data is from the dataset [morado_5may](https://www.kaggle.com/teddevrieslentsch/morado-5may).
